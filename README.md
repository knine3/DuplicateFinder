# Duplicated Picutes Finder

Techniques, I can think of, to find Duplicates:
- Same name
- Copy of ([0-9]) in name.
- Same content

- GUI, displays both pictures and asks the user if he wants to deletemthe duplicate. 
  (Always deletes the ([0-9]) version)   
- Advanced mode, use OpenCV to compare pictures
